# Fraud Detection App 🚨💳

Welcome to the **Fraud Detection App**, a cutting-edge **Streamlit** web application designed for **AI/ML-based anomaly detection of fraud** in financial transactions. This project was developed by **Team Binary Brains** as part of the **Pandora Paradox track** at **KIIT E-Summit 2025**.

---

## 🌟 Project Overview

Financial fraud often mimics legitimate transactions, making detection a challenging problem. Our app uses machine learning models trained on transaction data to detect paradoxical and hidden fraud patterns in UPI and credit transaction datasets.

Key features:
- Interactive data input for transaction attributes
- Real-time fraud prediction with probability scores
- Explainable insights highlighting suspicious transaction features
- Modern, cyberpunk-themed UI designed for hackathon impact

---

## 🧠 How It Works

1. Input transaction details such as amount, location, type, time, and user behavior indicators.
2. Our pre-trained ML pipeline processes inputs and predicts fraud likelihood.
3. The app displays an easy-to-understand fraud risk score with warnings if suspicious.
4. Visual and textual explainability helps users understand prediction drivers.

## 🎯 Hackathon Context

This project was created to address the challenge posed by **Pandora Paradox** at KIIT E-Summit 2025:

> _"Design an AI/ML-based anomaly detection system that identifies paradoxical fraud patterns within UPI or credit transaction datasets and provides explainable insights."_
